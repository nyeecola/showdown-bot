# Showdown bot

This is an bit that plays Pokémon Showdown.

Currently it is a very dumb AI and just plays random moves every turn. Also, it never switches to a benched pokémon unless it is via a move like Baton Pass, U-turn or Volt Switch.

To use this bot you must install PhantomJS and run `phantomjs main.js`.
PS: You should add your character name in the hardcoded `player_to_be_challenged` variable before running the program, because that's how the ai finds you to battle.
